# Feature Specification: API-First Habit Tracking App

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-an-api`
**Created**: 2025-09-17
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create an API-first habit tracking app using Next.js 14 + Supabase that displays visual progress grids like Checker app, designed for rapid Vercel deployment and future integration with Raycast, MCP, and mobile clients."

## Execution Flow (main)

```text
1. Parse user description from Input
   → If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement must be testable
   → Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   → If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   → If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

A user wants to track their daily habits through an API-first system. They can create habit boards, mark daily check-ins via API calls, and external applications (Raycast, MCP, mobile apps) can access this data to provide various interfaces and visualizations.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has received a magic link, **When** they click it to authenticate, **Then** the system creates their account and provides them with an API key
2. **Given** an authenticated user, **When** they make a POST request to create a habit board called "Morning Exercise", **Then** the API returns the created board with a unique ID
3. **Given** a user has an existing habit board, **When** they make a POST request to mark a check-in for today, **Then** the API records the completion and returns confirmation
4. **Given** a user has check-in data, **When** external applications make authenticated API requests, **Then** the system provides habit and check-in information in structured JSON format
5. **Given** a user wants to integrate with external tools, **When** they use their API key in requests, **Then** the system authenticates them and provides access to their data

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to mark a check-in for a future date?
- How does the API handle creating multiple check-ins for the same board and date?
- What occurs when a user deletes a board that has historical check-in data?
- How does the API handle requests with invalid or expired API keys?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to authenticate via magic links sent to their email
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to generate multiple API keys with custom labels and revocation capability
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow authenticated users to create, read, update, and delete habit boards via API
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to create, update, and delete boolean check-ins with additional metadata for specific boards and dates
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide classic RESTful API endpoints for all board, check-in, and API key operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST persist all user, board, and check-in data reliably with unlimited retention
- **FR-007**: System MUST support unlimited number of boards and check-ins per user
- **FR-008**: API MUST authenticate requests using API keys linked to user accounts
- **FR-009**: System MUST return structured JSON responses for all API operations
- **FR-010**: Board creation MUST require only a name field, with all other fields optional
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to retrieve their board and check-in data via API calls
- **FR-012**: System MUST support external integrations through API key authentication

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **User**: Represents an individual using the API, includes email for magic link authentication and multiple associated API keys
- **API Key**: Authentication token with custom label linked to a user account, supports revocation, used for API access by external applications
- **Board**: Represents a trackable habit or behavior, requires only name field, optional description and metadata, includes creation date and user ownership
- **Check-in**: Represents a boolean completion status for a board on a specific date, includes additional metadata fields, supports modification and deletion
